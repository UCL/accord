# ACCoRD – A Community for Contract Regulation for Data

ACCoRD public repository for the GitHub pages.

⚠️ Please do not include any private or sensitive data here – this is a public-facing repository.

ACCoRD aims to address barriers in data access and contracting that delay or block research using the UK’s federated Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI). Data contracts are often complex, bespoke, and inconsistent, causing delays of up to 9 months and making data sharing costly and inefficient.
