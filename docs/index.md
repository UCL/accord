# ACCoRD – A Community for Contract Regulation for Data

ACCoRD aims to address barriers in data access and contracting that delay or block research using the UK’s federated Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI). Data contracts are often complex, bespoke, and inconsistent, causing delays and making data sharing costly and inefficient.
