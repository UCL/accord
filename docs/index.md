      Project ACCoRD addresses the contracting challenges that currently hinder
      data from being accessed, moved and processed efficiently for ground-breaking research.
    </p>

    <p>
      A research data contract stipulates the terms under which data is shared for research purposes. It forms the foundation for
      the storage, management, transfer and use of data. However, the data contracting process is fraught with challenges, inefficiencies
      and uncertainty, which significantly delay or block innovative research.
    </p>

    <p>ACCoRD brings together experts in community engagement and data governance to deliver:</p>

    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li>the evidence, components and roadmap for a governance framework for data contracts in research, and</li>
      <li>a community to take that evidence forward</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Through stakeholder engagement and community development, we will understand the challenges and opportunities for
      data contracting, identify best practice models and produce solutions to unblock data for the UK’s Digital Research Infrastructure.
