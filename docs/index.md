    <h1>A Community for Contract Regulation for Data (ACCoRD)</h1>

    <p>
      ACCoRD aims to address barriers in data access and contracting that delay or block research
      using the UK’s federated Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI). Data contracts are often
      complex, bespoke, and inconsistent, causing delays and making data sharing costly and inefficient.
