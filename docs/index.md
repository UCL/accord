# ACCoRD

ACCoRD (A Community for Contract Regulation for Data) aims to address barriers in data access and contracting that delay or block research using the UKâ€™s federated Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI). Data contracts are often complex, bespoke, and inconsistent, causing delays and making data sharing costly and inefficient.
